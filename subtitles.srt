Welcome everyone. In this session, we are going to build a small but very practical automation project using Python.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This project is beginner friendly and focuses on solving a real problem that we all face in our daily computer usage.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before we start coding, let me briefly introduce myself. I am currently working as a Python Developer Intern, and I enjoy building automation tools that save time and effort.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In this video, I will walk you through an end to end Python project that demonstrates how automation works in real life.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Think about your downloads or desktop folder. Over time, it gets cluttered with different types of files such as documents, images, videos, and installers.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Manually sorting these files takes time and becomes frustrating. This brings us to an important question: can Python handle this task for us automatically?

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
To solve this problem, we will rely on some core Python concepts that allow programs to interact with the operating system.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:38,000
These concepts enable Python to read files, understand file types, create folders, and move files without any manual effort.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The logic of this project is straightforward but powerful. First, the program identifies a target folder. Then it scans every file inside that folder.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Based on the file type, it decides where the file should go. If a required folder does not exist, Python creates it automatically and moves the file to the correct location.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now let us understand how the code works. The script starts by accessing the target directory and loops through all the files one by one.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For each file, it checks the extension and creates a folder with the same name as the extension if needed.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Finally, the file is moved into that folder, resulting in a neatly organized directory.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:22,000
By completing this project, you now understand how Python can automate repetitive tasks and save significant manual effort.

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This same concept can be extended to many real world automation problems beyond file organization.

16
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That brings us to the end of this video. I hope this project helped you understand the power of Python automation.

17
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Keep practicing, keep building projects, and most importantly, enjoy coding. Thank you for watching.
